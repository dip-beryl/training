About :
    
    PostgreSQL is a free and open-source object-relational database management system 
    emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
    
    It supports Advanced data types such as arrays.

    PgAdmin is the GUI tool of PostgreSQL.


Installation (Linux - Debian) :

            $ sudo apt install postgresql

        * to install extensions and additions that are distributed along with the PostgreSQL sources :

            $ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

        * to check if the service of PostgreSQL is active or not :

            $ sudo systemctl is-active postgresql
            $ sudo systemctl is-enabled postgresql
            $ sudo systemctl status postgresql
        
        * Postgresql server is ready to accept connections from clients or not :

            $ sudo pg_isready

        ** START and STOP PostgreSQL Service :

            $ systemctl start postgresql
            $ systemctl stop postgresql

PostgreSQL Shell (psql):

    PostgreSQL Shell also known as psql is the shell
    where you can run SQL commands to manage databases.

        * Enter psql shell:

            $ sudo -su postgres
            $ psql

            OR,

            $ sudo -su postgres psql

               { OUTPUT : postgres-# }

    ** To run a SQL you can directly write the query in the shell terminal.

    - This Shell also have shortcuts of their own, some frequently use shortcuts are :

        \l  = list all databases

        \d  [table name] = describe table

        \du = list all users / roles
        \dt = list tables
        \dT = list data types
        \dv = list views
        
        \?  = help
        \q  = quit psql shell

        \i  [file]  = execute commands from file
        \o  [file]  = send all query results to file or |pipe
    
        \conninfo               = display information about current connection
        \password [username]    = securely change the password of a user
