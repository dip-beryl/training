Ruby popularly known as R.
Ruby is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose and complete object oriented programing language.

In ruby everything is an OBJECT even the data types.

1. Installation :

    To instal ruby first we install a enivorment manager i.e, RVM. 
    So, we need to import the GPG Keys of their moderator / maintainers for the safe installation.

        * Importing GPG Keys :

            $ curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg --import -        (mpapis is the username of maintainer)
            $ curl -sSL https://rvm.io/pkuczynski.asc | gpg --import -    (pkuczynski is the username of maintainer)

        (curl is a shell tool used to transfer and get data from various type of networks)
        (gpg is a tool for GPG Keys)

        * Get the list of keys installed :

            $ gpg --list-keys

        * Install RVM - ruby environment manager :

            $ curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

        - RVM to /home/beryl/.rvm/
        - Adding rvm PATH line to 
                /home/beryl/.profile 
                /home/beryl/.mkshrc 
                /home/beryl/.bashrc 
                /home/beryl/.zshrc.
    
        - Adding rvm loading line to 
                /home/beryl/.profile 
                /home/beryl/.bash_profile 
                /home/beryl/.zlogin.

        
        * To start using RVM you need to reload the shell :
            
            $ source ~/.bashrc

        * Version Check :

            $ rvm --version


2. Ruby Installation :

    Now we will install the ruby language in inside RVM :

        * Install ruby through RVM :

            $ rvm install ruby

            $ rvm install [version]    (for some specific version)

            $ rvm list known            (get a list of all install version options available)

        * List all the vesions of ruby that are installed :

            $ rvm list

        * using and setting a ruby version as default :

            $ rvm use [version]

            $ rvm use [version] --default

        ( some times you have to use the command $ /bin/bash --login befor the 'rvm use')

3. Running ruby commands :

    Ruby language statements can be executed through 'irb' integrated shell.

            $ irb

            - now run any ruby statement

    
    You can also run ruby files through :

            $ ruby file_name.rb

        *(ruby files have .rb extension)
