HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content

The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!


HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.



The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration :

    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.


ELEMENT :
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

    <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>


HTML Attributes :

    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

    Eg : <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

        - you should always use quotes around html attribute's values.


You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

    <html lang="en">


    <html lang="en-US">


Headings Are Important
    Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages

HTML Display

You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.


The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.


The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. It is simlar to <p> except the formatting text.

The HTML Style Attribute
    Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute

    Syntax:

        <tagname style="property:value;">

            - The property is a CSS property. 
            
            - The value is a CSS value.


        Some Exmaples :

        style="background-color:lightgrey;"
        style="font-size:50px"
        style="color:red; font-size:200%;"
        style="font-size:small"
        style="text-align:center"

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

    <b> - Bold text
    <strong> - Important text
    <i> - Italic text
    <em> - Emphasized text
    <mark> - Marked text
    <small> - Smaller text
    <del> - Deleted text
    <ins> - Inserted text
    <sub> - Subscript text
    <sup> - Superscript text


CSS:
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

        Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
        Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
        External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

        Internal:

            <style>
                body {background-color: powderblue;}
                h1   {color: blue;}
                p    {color: red;}
            </style>
            </head>

        External:

            <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
            </head>

Fevicon :

    A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.

    A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab.

Block and Inline:

    - Block element takes the full length of the display.

    - Span takes only the required space.

        Two most common block elements are :

            <div> and <p>

        For span it is :

            <span>


    - A <div> can be used to style a block on a page with CSS.
    - A <spna> can be used to style a text on a page with CSS.


        <div> is very popular and useful.

        - The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

Class : (Attribute)

    The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

    Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

    The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. 
    
    It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.


    Mainly it is used to mention the type of styling from the styling file. for any block. <div>


    Example:

        <div class="class_name">
        <div>

        In CSS:

            .class_name{
                styling attribute 1
                styling attribute 2
            }

        - in css class names start with (.)

    - Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.

    - Note: The class name is case sensitive!


ID :

    ID is similar to Class.

    Differeneces :

        Declaration :

                        class ==> .class_name
                        ID  ==>   #idname

        Behavior :

                        - one class can be used by multiple elements.

                        - one ID can be olny be used only single element.


<iframe> :

    The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

    An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

<script> :

    The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).

    The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the "src" attribute.

    Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

    To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.


Entity:

    some letters an symbols are reserverd by HTML.

    So if u want to use these reserverd keywords, we use entity names or entity numbers in place.


    Eg: 

            non-breaking space	&nbsp;	&#160;

        <	less than	        &lt;	&#60;

        &	ampersand	        &amp;	&#38;


Other Symbol codes :

        
        ðŸ˜…	&#128517;

        âˆ€	&#8704;	&forall;	FOR ALL

        Etc.

Semantic Elements:


    A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its conte
