CSS 

    - Cascading Style Sheets
    - CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media

    - CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    - External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

Syntax:

    --> selector(is a html tag) {property: value; property: value}

    - property is a CSS property.

    Example:

        - In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:

            p {
                color: red;
                text-align: center;
            }


Ways to apply CSS:

    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

        Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
        Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
        External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

        Internal:

            <style>
                body {background-color: powderblue;}
                h1   {color: blue;}
                p    {color: red;}
            </style>
            </head>

        External:

            <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
            </head>


CSS Selectors :
        CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

        1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
        2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
        3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
        4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
        5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


            ID selector :

                #para1 {
                        text-align: center;
                        color: red;
                    }

                - id name cannot start with number.


            Class selector:

                .center {
                        text-align: center;
                        color: red;
                    }

                - class name should start with (.)


            Universal Selector :

                * {
                    text-align: center;
                    color: blue;
                }

                - This CSS rule will affect every HTML element on the page.


            Grouping The Selectors :

                h1, h2, p {
                            text-align: center;
                            color: red;
                        }



The CSS Box Model :
    
    In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

    Explanation of the different parts:

        - Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
        - Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
        - Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
        - Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
