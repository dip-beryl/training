            > rails generate [GENERATOR TYPE] [name]


-> First we try to generate a [Controller ]

    - Controller name should be "CamelCased" or "under_score". 
    - You can pass a list of arguments. These arguments will become "Views".


    Syntax :
        > rails generate controller [controller_name] [view_name1 view_name2, ..]
            
            > rails genrate controller demo
            >> 
            --> create  app/controllers/demo_controller.rb
                invoke  erb
            --> create    app/views/demo
                invoke  test_unit
            --> create    test/controllers/demo_controller_test.rb
                invoke  helper
            --> create    app/helpers/demo_helper.rb
                invoke    test_unit

        - Above command created 3 files. and;
          1 folder for in app/views named same as controller "demo"

    --> the [views/demo ] folder is empty because we did not provide view names as arguments in shell command.


--------------------
-> Create a Controller with Views as arguments [Controller-View ]

     (remember to delete files that were created in last command)

        > rails g controller demo index
        >>
        --> create  app/controllers/demo_controller.rb
            route  get 'demo/index'  <----
            invoke  erb
        --> create    app/views/demo
        --> create    app/views/demo/index.html.erb
            invoke  test_unit
        --> create    test/controllers/demo_controller_test.rb
            invoke  helper
        --> create    app/helpers/demo_helper.rb
            invoke    test_unit

        - created 5 files and one folder.
        - 4 of the files and 1 folder is same as last shell command
        - 1 file that is new is the View "index.html.erb" that is created in [apps/views/demo ]folder
        - 1 new route is added to routes.rb file for the view "index"

        - You can execute your view in browser by accessing new route, just append the route in  "localhost:300"
            -> http://localhost:3000/demo/index

--------------------------------------

---------------------------------------

app/views/
File :: demo/index.html.erb                     # demo = controller name, index = view name

        - contains the HTML code for this specific view
