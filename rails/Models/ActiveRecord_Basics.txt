1. Active Record :

    Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic.
    Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.

    1.1 Active Record Pattern :

        - In Active Record, objects carry both persistent data and behavior which operates on that data.

    
    1.2 Object Relational Mapping (ORM):

        - It is a technique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in a relational database management system.

        - Using ORM, the properties and relationships of the objects in an application can be easily stored and retrieved from a database without writing SQL statements

    1.3 ORM Framework and Active Record :

        - Models and their data.
        - Associations between these models.
        - Inheritance hierarchies through related models.
        - "Validate models" - before they get persisted to the database.
        - Perform database operations - in an object-oriented fashion.
